# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the games

Each game is a self-contained HTML file — open directly in a browser:

```bash
open shooter.html
open tictactoe.html
```

No build step, no server, no dependencies.

## Repository conventions

- Every change gets a clean git commit and is pushed to `origin/main` (GitHub: `feiwang10000-prog/neon-siege`).
- Commit message format: one-line summary in imperative mood, optional body with bullet details, always ending with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

## Architecture — shooter.html

Single file: inline CSS → `<canvas id="c" 800×600>` → one `<script>` block.

**State machine:** `MENU → PLAYING ↔ PAUSED → GAME_OVER → MENU`
Driven by `Game.state` (values in `STATES` const); the RAF loop branches on it each frame.

**Core classes (all in the single script):**

| Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Game` | RAF loop, state machine, entity arrays, collision, score, screen-shake |
| `InputHandler` | `Set` of held keys, canvas-relative scaled mouse coords, `justClicked` one-shot flag |
| `Player` | Movement, angle-to-mouse, fire cooldown, walk cycle, invulnerability frames |
| `Enemy` | Per-type config lookup, direct + zigzag movement, contact damage timer |
| `Bullet` | Velocity vector, lifetime |
| `ParticleSystem` | Fixed pool of 400 objects reused on death; methods `spawnExplosion`, `spawnHit`, `spawnMuzzleFlash` |
| `LevelManager` | Wave queue, spawn timer, state `SPAWNING→WAITING→WAVE_CLEAR→next`; levels 1–3 hand-crafted, 4+ procedural |

**Camera:** world-space transform applied each frame — `ctx.translate(CANVAS_W/2 - player.x, CANVAS_H/2 - player.y)` — then restored before HUD drawing.

**Mouse scaling:** all mouse events use `getBoundingClientRect()` + CSS-scale correction so coordinates are always in canvas pixels regardless of window size.

**Collision:** circle-circle only. Bullet radius = 4, player radius = 12, enemy radius = enemy `size` value.

**Enemy types** (defined in `ENEMY_TYPES` const): `walker`, `runner`, `tank`, `zigzag` — each has `hp`, `speed`, `size`, `score`, `color`.

**Persistence:** high score saved to `localStorage` key `neonSiegeHi`.

## Architecture — tictactoe.html

DOM-based (no canvas). Game state is a 9-element array; winner detection checks all 8 lines after each move.
